# Asynchronous Requests

## Exercise
Use a public API to request a list of all countries, and display them in a React App.

- [ ] Create a new application called countries-list.
- [ ] Install your HTTP Request library of choice. I recommend axios.
- [ ] To fetch a list of countries in JSON format, make the following request:
GET https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all
- [ ] Display a loading spinner while the request is being made.
- [ ] Display the list of countries.
- [ ] Each country you list must also display their capital city and continent.
- [ ] Using the REST Countries API as reference, add the ability to search for countries in your app. You can use a text input and a button to fire the search.

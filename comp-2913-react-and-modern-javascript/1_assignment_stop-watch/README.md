# Stop Watch
Stop watch built in React. Styled after an older iOS version's stop watch.

## Assignment
Create a new React application, name it “stop-watch”.

- [x] Create a component called “StopWatch” and render it inside of your top level “App” component.

- [x] Your Stop Watch should render a timer that starts automatically when the View loads. The timer should be in the format “mm:ss”. Eg. 01:15 (1 minute and 15 seconds). Do not worry about times over 1 hour.

- [x] The timer should update the view every second.

- [ ] Display a button labeled “Pause”. This button pauses the timer.

- [ ] When paused, button should display “Start”. Clicking on it restarts the timer.

- [x] Display a button labeled “Reset”. This button resets the timer to 0 and stops the timer.

- [ ] When the timer is 0, the “Stop” button should be re-labeled as “Start”.

- [ ] Make sure to test it, to avoid bugs. What happens if the Start button is clicked multiple times? How about if the Stop button is clicked multiple times?

# React Router

## Exercise

- [ ] Create a new React application
- [ ] Create a Navbar Component. This component will have links to different sections of your application.
- [ ] Create a Home View, which will be the landing point of your application.
- [ ] Under the Navbar Component, create links to: “Rock Paper Scissors Game” and “Countries List”.
- [ ] Create components for each of those Views.
- [ ] Move code from past projects into this new project.
- [ ] Clicking on each Link should allow the user to see the respective project. These sub-projects should still work. If you have done it right, it should be very easy to reuse your old projects!
- [ ] Each of these views should have a unique url path. Use: /countries and /rock-paper-scissors.
- [ ] Add a redirect route for the countries list. If /countries-list is used as the url, it should redirect to countries.
- [ ] Add a Not Found page, which will display if any route not matching your existing Views is accessed.

Stretch Goals
- [ ] Modify your Countries List code so that when you search for a country, it will add that view to the browser history. Eg. /countries/canada. This should also work if the user first lands on your app through these paths.

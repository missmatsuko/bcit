# Todo App
Todo checklist app.

## Assignment
- [x] Create a new React application, name it “todo-app”.

- [x] This app will display a text input for the user, where they will be able to write a task.

- [x] A button should be displayed beside the input. When clicked, this button should add the user’s input to a list of to do items.

- [x] Blank items should not be added to the list. This can happen if the user presses the “Add” button without writing down a task.

- [x] The list could potentially have 0 to multiple items.

- [x] Each list item must display a checkbox, and the task that the user wrote.

- [x] When checking off the checkbox, the list item should be removed from the list.

- [x] Ensure that you make use of Components intelligently. Think about what should be extracted into a separate component, and do so.

If you breezed through the exercise above and would like a challenge, here are some ideas. Note that you will not get extra marks for these, they are purely for learning purposes only.

- [ ] Display a timestamp for each added item.

- [ ] Allow ordering the list by timestamp, ascending and descending.

- [ ] Allow for title and description for each to-do item.

- [ ] Allow sorting items by drag and drop. (For more advanced programmers who feel are already comfortable with React)
